Tradeoff is a website designed to allow people to share services with one another without needing currency.
They can do something for someone else in the community and earn credits.
Later, they can spend those credits when they need a service from someone else in the community.

For example, if someone gives your kid a ride to school one day, you can give their kid a ride another day.
The credit system forms accountability where people need to contribute about as much as they are receiving.
